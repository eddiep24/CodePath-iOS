Submitted by: Edmond (Eddie) Phillips

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can select between light and dark mode
- [X] Functional Settings View where the user can split the bill with a specific party size.

## Notes

While building the app there were many concepts I wasn't familiar with that I had to familiarize myself with.  One of the easier tasks I tried implementing was the UITextFieldDelegate.  Initially there was a learning curve that I had to overcome, but once I got the feel for the environment, learning the harder concepts became easier.
